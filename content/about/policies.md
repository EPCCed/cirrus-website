## Policies

The Cirrus policies form an integrated whole, based on the Terms and
Conditions of Access. They lay down both what we expect from Users, and
how we will carry out the commitments we make to them in the Terms and
Conditions.

  - [Terms and Conditions of Access](../policy-tandc/)
  - [Personal Data and Privacy Policy](../policy-privacy/)
  - [Policy on end of life procedures for Cirrus user accounts and
    projects](../policy-closure/)

In addition, Cirrus access also falls within the remit of the Computing
Regulations and Security Policy of the University of Edinburgh and all
users who sign up for a SAFE and/or Cirrus account agree to these
conditions of access:

  - [University of Edinburgh Computing
    Regulations](http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/about/policies-and-regulations/computing-regulations)
  - [University of Edinburgh Security
    Policy](http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/about/policies-and-regulations/security-policies/security-policy)
