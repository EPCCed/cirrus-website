## Cirrus Service Desk

The Service Desk is the first point of contact for all questions relating
to the Cirrus facility.

Support is available Monday to Friday from
08:30 until 18:00, excluding UK public holidays.

The Service Desk can be reached by e-mail [support@cirrus.ac.uk](mailto:support@cirrus.ac.uk).

Please try and provide as much background information as possible as this will
speed up the processing time considerably. Existing Cirrus users will be asked
for their user ID, project code, and, where applicable, the commands they are
using and the error message they get.

## How the Service Desk ticket system works

When a query is submitted by email it is placed in the SAFE query system.

When you email your query, you will normally get an automatic acknowledgment by
email, including a tracking ID, within a few minutes. If you submit your query
through SAFE, it will give you a tracking ID at once. A few minutes later,
your query will be assigned to the appropriate expert within the Cirrus team
to handle.

The expert may contact you to discuss your problem or to get extra information.
Finally, the expert will send you an answer, and the query will be closed. At
this point the Service Desk will send you another message, telling you that this has
happened.

Closed queries are kept in the SAFE database, so that we can refer back to them
when solving future problems, and when writing documentation, etc. The SAFE
database is protected by the
[Cirrus Personal Data and Privacy Policy](/about/policies/privacy.html)
