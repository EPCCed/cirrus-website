title: Pump Priming Access
summary: Pump-priming access to test Cirrus for your research
---

As a pump priming opportunity for new users, Cirrus offers
access to Cirrus for a limited number of Core-h over a six month period.
This mode of access should give new users the opportunity to test Cirrus
for their purposes and work towards a fully peer reviewed application,
either via a standard grant or via
Access to HPC calls. An extension will only be granted
in exceptional cases.

**Note:** Only one Pump Priming project is available to each person.

## Resources available

You can apply for a maximum of 80,000 coreh over a six month period to test
the Cirrus service for your work.

## Application proceedure

A [Cirrus Instant Access Technical Assessment Form](ta/Cirrus-TA-Instant-form.docx)
should be completed by you and sent to the [Cirrus Service Desk](../service-desk/).

The Cirrus CSE service will evaluate the technical feasibility of the project.

These short projects are not evaluated further, unless an extension is required.
