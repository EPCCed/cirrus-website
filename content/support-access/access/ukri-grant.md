summary: Adding Cirrus access to research grants
---

You can include Cirrus on UKRI funding applications when you are applying for funding (if you already have an active grant then you should consider applying via one of the calls for Cirrus time only that are described
on our [Access page](./).

## Resource Available

We would normally expect Grant Access applications to be around 500,000 - 2,000,000 coreh per annum but we do have larger projects than this. Please contact the [Cirrus Service Desk](../service-desk/) to discuss if you have larger requirements.

## Application procedure

When submitting proposals to EPSRC Standard Mode (Grant) that include Cirrus resources on the UKRI Funding Service, you should add Cirrus  under Section 6: Facilities

- facility name: Cirrus
- usage: the requested resource in Core-h as *unit* and the notional cost in £ as *cost*. Reasonable Cirrus allocations are
now awarded for the duration of the EPSRC funding. 
   - Cirrus notional cost for UKRI Grant proposals : £0.0092 per corehh
- confirmation of facility agreement: This is a completed [Technical Assessment Form](https://www.cirrus.ac.uk/access/ta/Cirrus-TA-Grant-form.docx)   prior to submission.  Should an application be funded then grant funding would not be released until EPSRC have had sight of the relevant TA, as provided by the facility. 

For other grant schemes, please contact the funding call contact listed on the UKRI call page to discuss how Cirrus resources should be added.
