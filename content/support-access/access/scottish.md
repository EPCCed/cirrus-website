title: Scottish Academic Access
summary: Access to use or test Cirrus for your research
---

Researchers at Scottish academic institutions can get free access to Cirrus for 
their research. This can be either a small amount of time for test access or 
larger amounts for production-type runs.

**Note:** Only researchers in Scottish academic institutions are eligible.

**Note:** Typically, only one Scottish Access application will be funded per 
research group. Short, trial-access, projects can be converted into longer access
with larger resources if the trial is successful.

## Resources available

We would expect applications for test access to be a maximum of around 80,000 coreh and production access to be for a maximum of 
1,000,000 coreh. 

Test access will be for 6 months and production access for 1 year.

## Application procedure

A [Cirrus Scottish Academic Access Technical Assessment Form](..//Cirrus-TA-ScotAccess-form.docx)
should be completed by you and sent to the [Cirrus Service Desk](../../user-support/).

The Cirrus CSE service will evaluate the technical feasibility of the project and this will
be passed to Cirrus management for approval.
