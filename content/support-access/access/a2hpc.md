---

UKRI Access to HPC calls provide an open and relatively flexible route to computational support for projects in an UKRI remit. You can access national Tier-2 HPC systems. 

These calls are for researchers to apply for computational resource from EPSRC funded High Performance Computing (HPC) services to support research projects from across any UKRI research remit. It is the successor to the ARCHER RAP and Tier-2 Open access calls which ran prior to 2020. Projects can run for up to 12 months. This call usually opens twice a year.

The services available are most of the national Tier-2 HPC service.
