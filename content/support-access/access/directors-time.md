title: UoE Director's Time Access
summary: Access for University of Edinburgh researchers to use Cirrus for your research
---

Researchers at The University of Edinburgh can get free access to Cirrus for 
their research. This can be either a small amount of time for test access or 
larger amounts for production-type runs.

**Note:** Only University of Edinburgh researchers or visiting researchers are eligible.

## Resources available

We would expect applications for test access to be a maximum of around 80,000 coreh and production access to be for a maximum of 
1,000,000 coreh.

Test access will be for 6 months and production access for 1 year.

## Application procedure

A [Cirrus Director's Time Application Form](..//Cirrus-TA-DirectorTime-form.docx)
should be completed by you and sent to the [Cirrus Service Desk](../../user-support/).

The Cirrus CSE service will evaluate the technical feasibility of the project and this will
be passed to Cirrus management for approval.
