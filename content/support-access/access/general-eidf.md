title: General Academic Access (via EIDF)
summary: Access to use Cirrus for your research
---

Any academic researcher can get access to Cirrus via the
[Edinburgh International Data Facility](https://edinburgh-international-data-facility.ed.ac.uk/).

## Resources available

This access route is flexible in terms of the amount of resource that can be applied for. For 12 months
of access projects have typically requested 500,000 -- 3,000,000 coreh and storage of 100 -- 100,000 GiB
but larger projects are possible and smaller projects can gain Cirrus access via this route too.

In the list of resources available on the EIDF list, the following are relevant to Cirrus:

Compute Services:

- *CPU-only in the Cirrus cluster* - use this to indicate the number of coreh you require

Storage:

- *CephFS with 3-copies redundancy* - this corresponds to the amount of space you require on the Cirrus home file system
- *e1000* - this corresponds to the amount of space you require on the Cirrus work file system (accessible to compute nodes)

Other EIDF services that can be used directly from Cirrus include:

- *EIDF S3 without backup* - EIDF S3 storage can be accessed from Cirrus login and compute nodes

## Application procedure

Follow the [EIDF Access Process](https://edinburgh-international-data-facility.ed.ac.uk/access).
