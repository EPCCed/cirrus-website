## Industry Access

Cirrus has been designed to support a wide range of industry applications and EPCC can provide both
access to HPC resources and also consultancy to effectively exploit HPC resources.

Please see the dedicated [industry solutions page on the EPCC website](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/industry-solutions).

## Academic Access Routes

Cirrus is one of the [UKRI](http://www.ukri.ac.uk) Tier-2 National HPC facilities and there are 
number of different academic access routes available.

The table below provides a summary of the different academic access routes. For new users who want
to test out Cirrus for their research, we recommend the Pump Priming or Driving Test routes. For 
researchers who need access to larger amounts of resource, the UKRI Access to HPC calls, Scottish
Academic Access or grant access routes are more suitable.

[contact the Cirrus Service Desk](../user-support/) in the first instance to discuss.

## Resource Units

Access to Cirrus is currently granted in units of:

- coreh for compute allocations: 1 Cirrus coreh is the equivalent of 1 physical core used for 1 hour
- GiB for disk allocations: 1 GiB is 1048576 kB.
