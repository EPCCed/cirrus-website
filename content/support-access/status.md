## Current System Load

The plot below shows the status of the CPU nodes on the current Cirrus service for the past day

A description of each of the status types is provided below the plot.

## Service Maintenance Sessions

{{< open-maintenance >}} 

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occasionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
