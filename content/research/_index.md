## Optimization of rotor blades for Martian Helicopters

*Prof. Peter Vincent (Imperial College London)*

The NASA Mars helicopter, Ingenuity, successfully carried out the first ever powered flight on another planet. However, the unique conditions on Mars, including its very thin atmosphere (less than 1% of the density of Earthâ€™s), create challenges for the design of new aerial vehicles for further exploration of the planet

## Agricultural field boundary delineation: enabling sustainable land stewardship

*Dr. Simon Fraval (University of Edinburgh)*

Across the globe, agriculture is under strain from economic and
environmental pressures and farmers often have to make decisions in
the absence of full information. Earth Observation satellite data
can help inform decisions, but the benefits are limited by the
complex nature of delineating field boundaries. Research led
by the University of Edinburgh has used Machine Learning
techniques to increase the accuracy and decrease the costs
of doing this.

## Simulating Quantum Circuits on GPUs

*Joseph Lee (EPCC, University of Edinburgh)*

The field of quantum computing is developing at a rapid pace, with exciting developments in every sub-field including hardware development and algorithm design. The current era of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers may limit the size of problems we are able to solve on actual quantum hardware, we are still identifying more and more use cases which may benefit from the limited quantum resources, especially by utilizing both quantum and classical HPC hardware via hybrid algorithms.
